# Infant Mortality Rate in America

### Where is the worst place in the U.S. to start your life?


According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), "infant mortality is the number of infant deaths that occur before age 1 per 1,000 live births.Infant mortality varies from 4.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in Massachusetts to 8.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in Mississippi. Nationally, the infant mortality rate is 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births."
    
Based on CDC data, Mississippi is "the worst" state to be an infant. Such data viz has been done before, the new angle I'm looking at is to break down states futher into most problematic counties and cities accross the United States.
    
For example, the CDC ranks California's infant death as 4.5 per 1,000 live births. However, Fresno's infant mortality rate is double the state average, which makes Fresno’s preterm birth rate close to Mississpi's and is on par with some of the poorest countries in the world (like in East Africa). What’s more, 40 percent of preterm births occur in a two-by-five-mile sector with high poverty and poor access to health care.    
    
So my goal is to "zoom in" and identify the worst American "corners" leading to this outcome in infants' lives and analyze what factors contribute to mortality, such as poverty level, edcucation level, parents health and environmental factors. 
    
I can track the dynamic of infant mortality from 1990s to 2016 and see how it changes and what factors contribute more or less in certain periods of time, including how moratlity changes demographically.
    
    
Type of charts: color-coded maps disecteded by regions changing in intensity of color with years that would correspond to how the index of mortality goes up or down in certain areas. And graphic slopes for perhaps five states with the lowest mortality rate and five states with the highers mortality rate, listing years in X axes, mortality index in Y axes and specific areas of a state in details visualized as small circles (dots) on a slope.
    
Data sources: CDC, state Dpt of Public Health branches, CalEnviro screen data.    

P.S.     
If I find the country-wide analysys too overwhelming, I might just focus on analzying California. (TBD)
